For the project description, summarize the description of the project (less than 100 characters of text) into a resume bullet point style, starting with an action verb. Don't include any bullet point characters or periods in project description, and keep project description within 100 characters of text, retaining only the most important information. All sections must have a maximum of 100 characters of text - this is a strict limit.
